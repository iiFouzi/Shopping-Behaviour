🛍️ Shopping Behavior Data Analysis
📊 Project Overview

This project explores shopping behavior data to uncover insights about customer spending patterns, product preferences, and purchasing frequency.
It focuses on understanding how factors like age, category, payment method, and spending level influence customer behavior.

The analysis uses Python for data exploration and visualization — aiming to simulate the workflow of a junior data analyst performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

Python 🐍

Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib – Visualizations (pie charts, bar charts, line plots)

Seaborn – Advanced statistical plots (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Loading & Cleaning

Missing values handled appropriately

Columns renamed and formatted for clarity

Categorical Analysis

Pie charts showing the distribution of customer demographics, preferences, and purchase details

Focus on variables like Gender, Category, Payment Method, Shipping Type, etc.

Numerical Analysis

Histograms and boxplots for numerical features such as Age, Purchase Amount (USD), Review Rating, and Previous Purchases

Mean and median lines added to show skewness

Customer Segmentation

Classified customers as Big Spenders (> $50) or Small Spenders

Analyzed spending frequency and category distribution between both groups

Behavioral Patterns

Explored how Age affects purchase frequency

Investigated correlations between numeric features using a heatmap

📈 Visuals & Highlights

Multi-plot layouts for efficient comparison across variables

Clean and consistent styling (labels, legends, and grid lines)

Clear separation of categorical vs. numerical insights

Line plots to visualize trends and group behaviors
